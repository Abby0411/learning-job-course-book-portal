**Learning – Job, Course & Book Portal**
This folder contains a MERN-based learning and career discovery portal that helps users explore jobs, courses, and books in a single place. Recruiters can quickly understand my full‑stack skills and how I design end‑to‑end products.​

**What this project showcases**

- 		Full‑stack development with React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB (MERN).​
- 		Clean separation of frontend and backend, with REST APIs, authentication, and data modeling.​
- 		Practical problem‑solving for real‑world use cases like job search, course discovery, and learning resources.​

**Why this project is in “learning”**
This project is part of my continuous learning track, where I experiment with features that matter in real products: filtering, search, protected routes, and integration between multiple domains (jobs, courses, and books). It reflects how I approach building production‑style applications and improving them over time.​
