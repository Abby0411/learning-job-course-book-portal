# Learning Job / Course / Book Portal (MERN)

A full-stack MERN application that helps users explore jobs, courses, and books in one place, built as a learning and portfolio project to showcase end-to-end product development skills. 

## Highlights for recruiters

- MERN stack: React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB with clean separation of frontend and backend. 
- REST APIs with authentication, CRUD operations, and structured data models for jobs, courses, and books. 
- Practical UI for searching, filtering, and viewing learning resources relevant to career growth. 

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Axios, modern CSS. 
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, JWT-based auth (or prepared hooks for it), validation and routing. 
- **Database:** MongoDB with collections for jobs, courses, and books. 

## What this project demonstrates

- Ability to design and structure a real-world MERN project with separate `frontend` and `backend` folders. 
- Writing clean API endpoints, handling requests/responses, and integrating them with a React client. 
- Thinking about users’ learning and career journeys by connecting jobs, courses, and books in a single portal. 

## Repository structure

- `frontend/` – React app for the user interface and client-side routing. 
- `backend/` – Express server, routes, controllers, and database interaction.
- `learning/` – Context about how this project fits into a broader “learning” track in this GitHub profile. 
## How to run locally

- Clone the repo and install dependencies in both `frontend` and `backend` folders using `npm install`. 
- Start backend (for example `npm run dev`) and frontend (`npm start`) in separate terminals, then open the given localhost URL in a browser.
